### Chrome plugin to enable instant chat for any Youtube video

# Problem Statement
Youtube's inbuilt chat is a persistent , question and answer based model(at least people think like this) so they don't expect instant reply or answer to their comment even though there are many concurrent users watching the same video 

# Solution 
integrating the instant realtime chat(short-lived messages) functionality directly into the YouTube page  using a chrome plugin offers a promising approach to providing real-time interaction for already uploaded videos. But in order to make it success it has to have huge adoption(so whenever a user want's to chat they has to be other party to reply)
